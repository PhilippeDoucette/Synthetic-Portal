# Synthetic-Portal

The project is a Powerwall display, built in Unity.
The concept is to create a 3D wall display that does not require the user to wear glasses, a HMD, or any other tracking device. Ordinary people could enter the viewspace and be presented with a convincing display of distant landscapes, as if they were looking out a window or balcony.
